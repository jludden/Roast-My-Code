# Roast My Code

### Idea
This repository started as a test bed for me to learn many new technologies: React, Typescript, GraphQL, AWS Amplify, and many more. In fact, when I first started writing it I was almost exclusively a back-end developer, with a very fragile grasp of HTML, CSS, and React. With that in mind, don't be surprised to find some truly terrible and un-idiomatic React code in this repository. I'm okay with that - my goal was to learn these technologies, not to master them. I like to think that if I was reviewing a pull request of this quality, I would send it back with quite a few comments. What issues can you find?
