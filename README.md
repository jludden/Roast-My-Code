# [Roast My Code](http://www.roast-my-code.com)

## About
This repository started as a test bed for me to learn many new technologies: React, Typescript, GraphQL, and other web technologies like Firebase and AWS. Although I hacked some npm packages together, the truth is I still have a very limited understanding of all of the above. With that in mind, don't be surprised to find some truly terrible and un-idiomatic code in this repository. I'm okay with that - my goal was to ~~pad my resume~~ broadly learn about modern web tech, not to become a master overnight. I like to think that if I was reviewing a pull request of this quality, I would send it back with quite a few comments. What issues can you find?
